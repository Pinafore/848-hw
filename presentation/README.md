Why we're doing this
====================
There's a lot of research going on in this fast-moving field.  It's
worthwhile to do a roundup of recent research so that we're all aware
of the recent trends of prominent papers.

How long do you have
====================
Your presentation should be ten minutes.  You don't need to review
machine reading, standard datasets, or the motivation for QA.  So
don't use your precious time on stuff that "we already know".

Focus on the contributions of this paper rather than the related
works.

We'll then have five minutes for questions.

What to Focus On
================
First, talk about what makes the paper interesting.  Why is it worth
knowing about?

Then, talk about the specifics of its contribution.  What did it do
that other papers didn't.

Feel free to talk about the presentation of the paper; we'll be
talking more about how to write a good paper, so if there are lessons
to learn from this paper about presentation, share them!

You can then talk about any limitations or problems the paper has.  Be
honest but kind.  This might motivate a new extension / project based
on the ideas of the paper.  Mention that at the end.

How to Divide Work
==================
It's fine to divide work however you want.  One person can make
slides, one person can talk, one person can make figures.  Or all
three people can talk.  It's up to you, as long as the group agrees.

Do you Have to Present on One of these Papers?
==============================================
I have a list of paper ideas here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNU_Ci52WQn01d3L3e9CzrYaEZsHBRytyMIPa289cQs/edit?usp=sharing

But you don't have to present one of these papers!  Just get
permission on Piazza for a different paper, and add it to the list.

How to sign up for a slot
=========================
Put your group name next to a date in the spreadsheet.  We'll reserve
the first week for virtual presentations.
