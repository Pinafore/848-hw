Where to Submit
===============

This must be submitted to Gradescope and *ON TIME*.  

Cover Letter
=============
There are some things that don't go into the final project writeup.  Thus, please write a cover letter that discusses:
* Who did what
* What logistical challenges did you have
* Anything else we need to know to grade the paper

It could be that your cover letter just says: 

I Have a Teammate Who Didn't Do Anything
========================================
If your team cannot agree on a consensus cover letter, each member can submit their own cover letter.  However, do not duplicate the rest of the submission (e.g., every team member can upload a cover letter but there's only one project ... or {A, B} upload one cover letter, C uploads another, but there's still only one writeup).

What to Upload
===============
Please upload your:
* Poster
* Paper
* Cover letter, which should include
  * A link to your source code repository
  * Cover letter
  * (Optional) A link to your paper source 

How this will be Graded
=======================
The grade will be out of 25 points, broken into five areas:

* _Presentation_: For your oral presentation, do you highlight what
  you did and make people care?  Did you use time well during the
  presentation?

* _Writeup_: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is
  clear and effective?

* _Technical Soundness_: Did you use the right tools for the job, and
  did you use them correctly?  Were they relevant to this class?

* _Effort_: Did you do what you say you would, and was it the right
  ammount of effort?

* _Results_:  How well did your techniques perform, and how thorough and insightful is your analysis?



Submitting to ArXiv
===================

Please do not submit to ArXiv unless I specifically encourage you to do so.  The anonymity deadline for EMNLP is May 24, so if you want to submit there, it must be submitted to ArXiv by that date.  Again, however, do not submit unless I have explicitly given you permission.
