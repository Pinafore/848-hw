What you Have to Turn In
========================

As before, you'll be expanding your draft.  This time you'll be adding two new sections.  You can turn it in on Gradescope as before.


Results (Baseline)
==================

Having established your experiment plan in the last checkpoint, you'll expand it to include your baseline numbers.  If this doesn't come from previous work, you'll need to run your baseline on your data.  Here are some examples of what baseline results look like:
* If you're extending a model, run the model you're extending on a dataset
* If you're doing an analysis of a dataset, run the first pass analysis.  E.g., if you're computing demographic bias, you can compute the proportion of entities of any type in a question.
* If you're generating a dataset, generate a small number of examples (a dozen) and run the analysis you're going to run on them.
* If you're implementing a new model, have an "ablated" version with the bare minimum to go end to end.

Related Work
============

In this section, you'll mention all of the related work that touches on similar topics as your paper.  Don't worry about space, rather focus on completeness.  If you're not using bibtex yet to generate your references, start!

Remember this should be at the *end* of the paper.  Introduce any tightly related work (absolutely necessary to understand what you're doing) at the *start* of the paper.
