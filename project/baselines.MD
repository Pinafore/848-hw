What you Have to Turn In
========================

As before, you'll be expanding your draft.  This time you'll be adding two new sections.  You can turn it in on Gradescope as before.


Results (Baseline)
==================

Having established your experiment plan in the last checkpoint, you'll expand it to include your baseline numbers.  If this doesn't come from previous work, you'll need to run your baseline on your data.

Related Work
============

In this section, you'll mention all of the related work that touches on similar topics as your paper.  Don't worry about space, rather focus on completeness.  If you're not using bibtex yet to generate your references, start!
