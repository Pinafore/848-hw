Do I have to turn anything in?
==============================
No, this is optional.  Hence the name.

Can I turn something in?
========================
Yes, you may turn in your paper for this optional checkpoint if you turned in something to the "conforming" checkpoint that identified a specific issue that you can (and have) address in the time available.

Do I have to turn in the whole paper?
=====================================
No, and I'd rather you not.  Just give the part that has changed and please identify the feedback that you want.  This doesn't have to be in the format of the official paper submission.
