What to turn in
===============
As usual, you'll be turning in an updated draft of your project writeup.  There will be a place to submit on Gradescope.

What does it mean to be conforming?
===================================

This should contain every section that is in a final project writeup.  It should obey the constraints of the venue that you're submitting to: e.g., page limits, formatting, etc.  

Do I have to have everything done?
==================================

No, in particular you're likely not going to have every experiment finished and you're probably not going to have all of your analysis finished.  That's fine!  But you should have some results here and lay out the general outline of how you'd present the results.  If you're presenting results in a table, you can write it as "TBD".  In a graph form, just have the score as 0.0 or -1.0.
