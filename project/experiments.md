What you have to do
=============

For this checkpoing, you need to share a draft of a paper with a revised abstract, a title, an introduction, and an experiments section.


Team Size
=======

You can have up to four people on your team for this assignment.  Final teams can have up to five people, so there's a little wiggle room later for shuffling around later,but hopefully you should be nearing your final groups.

Revised Abstract and Title
=================

Given feedback from your abstract submission and new insights that you get from writing the experiments section, revise your abstract.  You'll also need to provide a title (if you didn't last time).  The title should, like the abstract, help a reviewer figure out if they're a good match for the paper and to give a good sense of what the paper is about.  Unlike the abstract, your title should also be memorable so that people can easily Google it later after they've been blown away by your conference presentation.

Experiments
========

Let's be clear about something up front: you don't have to do your experiments yet (but you can and should start as soon as possible).  It's fine to write the experiments section before you've done them.  A good experiments section should provide enough information to allow someone to replicate your experiments, so in writing the experiments section you'll be laying out the blueprint for how your team will do the experiments.  Be sure to mention things like framework, learning rate (if you're not using defaults), data / models you're taking from other papers, and (most importantly) the reason for your experiments.  For example, you shouldn't just say, "we apply a transformer to New York Times data".  Instead, you should say something like "to see whether pretraining with newswire data helps us better predict fake news from Tweets, we train a transformer on New York Times data to better account for the people and places typically mentioned in Tweets".

Introduction
========

Writing a good introduction is hard.  This will probably be the section you revise the most since even if what you do never changes (which is unlikely), how to convince somebody that your paper is interesting relevant will probably change as you get more insights.  So don't stress too much about it, the introduction is probably going to change many times.  A good introduction should: get the reader excited about the paper, set up the important intellectual question, reference any of the *critical* background research, and give a good sense of what the paper is going to be about.  That said, an introduction shouldn't be more than a page.

Format
=====
Select a reasonable conference publication format (e.g., NeurIPS or ARR) for your submission.
