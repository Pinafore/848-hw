What you have to do
===================

To propose the project you'll complete for the class, write an
abstract of the paper that will result.

This should be 5-7 sentences, following the CGI model from Dreyer:
motivate with the first sentence, explain the specific
problem/question you're addressing, and then explain what you will do.

How to Submit
=============

Post your abstract as a followup to a thread we'll create on Piazza.

What details to include
=======================

Make sure to talk about the datasets you'll use and the general type
of models / data you'll use.

Of course, the form of an abstract doesn't allow you to put all the
details you'd need, but part of the goal of this assignment is to give
you freedom to think about the broad outlines without fussing about
the details.

But I haven't done anything yet!
================================

That's fine; it's okay to either optimistically talk about the kind of
results you'll get (i.e., make stuff up).  Or talk about results in
future tense.

How you'll be graded
====================

The grade for the project is reflected in the final paper you produce,
so there won't be individual grades for these intermediate steps.

Group size
==========

For this milestone, you can team up with up to one other person.  As
you'll notice that this is substantially smaller than the maximum
group size that you can have for the final project.  The thinking is
that we'll be able to generate lots of ideas now and that teams can
join up if they have similar project ideas or if the initial crazy
ideas in an abstract don't pan out.
