Similar wave-like disturbances in the collective structure of this property for a crystal lattice are quantized into magnons. This property separates orthohydrogen from parahydrogen, and its total value is 0 for singlet states and 1 for triplet states. This property causes a beam of silver atoms sent through an inhomogeneous magnetic field to split into two beams instead of forming a continuous band. This property, described by a set of Hermitian unitary matrices named for Wolfgang Pauli, was discovered in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. For 10 points, name this intrinsic form of angular momentum, whose quantum number can be plus or minus one-half for electrons.",

This element is used in the Bechamp reduction. The first known ligands of hapticity 5 were bonded to a central atom of this metal. It's not aluminum, but this element's trichloride is often used as a catalyst in the chlorination of arenes. This element is present both as the counter-ion and in the central complex ion of the dye Prussian blue. An alloy of this element and carbon can undergo martensite or pearlite phase transitions.
