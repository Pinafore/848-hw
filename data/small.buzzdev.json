Aryl versions of this functional group can be synthesized by adding carbon monoxide, hydrochloric acid, and aluminum trichloride to a benzene ring in a variant of the Friedel-Crafts reaction named for Gattermann and Koch. These compounds produce a peak at around 9-10 ppm in proton NMR. PCC will selectively oxidize primary alcohols to these compounds, which can be oxidized again to form carboxylic acids.
